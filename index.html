  <p>
 It will spit out a sfz file you can use in any sfz player vst like sfizz or sforzando. You can take it one step further by opening it up with polyphone, saving it as sf2, then you can enjoy it using soundfont player in fl studio. if you dont have fl, juicy sf is a good alternative sf2 player.
